==========Unleashed Project: The Complete Addon==========

The DEFINITIVE Experience of the Unleashed Stages in Generations

So we see mods that add onto the unleashed project which are all unique in their own way & we see people
aksing about combining mods. It's about time someone has answered their prayers ;) 

What is in the addon?

This addon combines:
- Unleashing Unleashed Project by Kagenoki
- Unleashed Project Original Lighting by TuanPingas
- A Re-work of all of the Unleashed Level Cameras by Exe.Qution 

Along with removing unnecessary objects, restoring more discrete cameras, correct object placements and
some extra Scene Effect editing, this aims to be the most accurate version of a game I hold very close to my heart 
and that is Sonic Unleashed

The Enemy Trigger mod by brianuuSonic is also part of this mod along with the Quick Step Fix. 

The config of this mod provides:

- Unleashed Physics: Choose to play with Sonic Unleashed-like physics.

- Jump Selector button icons: Choose between PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 button icons for Jump Selectors.

- World map music for HUB World: Determine whether you want the world map music from Sonic Unleashed 
                                 should play in the HUB world rather than the separate tracks

- Speed Down In Aero Chaser Section: Choose to enable the speed being decreased when you enter a chaser
                                     section - just like Sonic Unleashed (Archxe told me to do this -_-)

Unfortunately, due to some limitations of Sonic Generations, some areas were not replicated
properly and had to be improvised in order for the mod to run smoothly, 
such as the camera in Windmill Isle Act 2 before the first 2D section and 
the JJ aero chaser section
 
       
As usual, this DOES require you to already have the Unleashed Project downloaded as this mod 
doesn't contain the .pfd files


  
-----Known issues-----

- Sometimes the cars in Empire City may stand still for an odd reason; you may want to
  just ignore that factor and continue to play regularly

- The Drum sound effects in Savanna Citadel seem to cut quiet for split seconds
  (It may be that it's Stereo and not Mono idk :/)
