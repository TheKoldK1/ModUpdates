# Introduction
So The Unleashed Project mod for Sonic Generations came out in 2013 and although it did please the majority of us Sonic Fans, 
a lot of aspects of the stages were missed out. 

We have seen a few mods that add onto the unleashed project which are all unique in their own way but never maximised the ability to 
make the stages look 1:1 to their SU counterpart, which is why we see requests about combining mods.
It’s about time someone decided to take the upper-hand and answer their prayers ;)

So I introduce to you - __Unleashed Project: The Complete Addon!__


# What does this addon provide?
This addon aims to restore majority of the Sonic Unleashed daytime gameplay experience that were not present or missing in the initial Unleashed Project, 
which includes the __Unleashing Unleashed Project by Kagenoki (which restores the Jump Selectors and no trick Rainbow Rings)__, 
__Original Lighting by TuanPingas (Pretty Self-explanatory)__ & a re-work of all the unleashed level cameras by my partner in crime __Exe.Qutionn__.
Along with removing unnecessary objects, restoring more discrete cameras, correct object placements, some extra Scene Effect editing and a couple of 
extra tweaks of our own, the mod's goal is to be the most accurate version of a game I hold very close to my heart and that is Sonic Unleashed

This addon's target is to be the successor of what the OG Unleashed Project intended to achieve 

All of this was done through constant XML editing and looking at the objects via SonicGLvl and I don't think this would have been possible 
if it weren't for Kagenoki lending me the unlocked version of his mod in the first place so thank you very much for that  

## More Additions
- The addon also implements the Enemy Trigger code by brianuuuSonic as well as the Quick Step Fix for Unleashed Project

- Sonic Unleashed Style Enemies by Iulian is part of this mod as well, with restored animations and better particle effects by Exe.Qutionn

- We have also implemented the Egg Devil Ray Boss Arena to replace the Silver Boss Fight thanks to Archxe

- Exe.Qutionn's SU Title Screen (not to be confused with Nextin's SWA Title Screen) and Stagegate UI is now part of this mod. 
Now you will no longer need to use his Unleashed UI mod due to the consistent elements of said mod being used here and due to 
the huge updates that the Sonic Unleashed HUD mod has received 

- This mod has compatibility with brianuuuSonic's Reappear Red Ring mod, meaning after you collect a Sun/Moon Medal, a transparent one will show in stages.

- And after so long, QTEs have now been restored in this mod thanks to brianuuuSonic

- We have also worked to bring in the DLC variants of the main stages to give you __Unleashed Project: The Complete Addon DLC EDITION__

We also worked with Loco to restore some unique features within this mod which only work if SU Restorations is enabled alongside it 
# NOTE: WHEN USING SU RESTORATIONS, PLEASE DISABLE THE “RINGS INCREASE SPEED” OPTION IN THE CONFIG AS THAT BREAKS ENEMY CHASER AND GUN TRUCK SECTIONS


 

__Unfortunately, due to some limitations of Sonic Generations, some areas could not be replicated properly and had to be 
improvised in order for the mod to run smoothly, you'll notice while you play__

Because this is an addon you will need to download the original Unleashed Project mod before playing this

Make sure that this mod goes above the Unleashed Project in HedgeModManager

The RTX Fix for Unleashed Project by TuanPingas is now part of the config of this mod. So enable this option 
if you tend to have issues when loading into the HUB World
If you’re using Direct3D9Ex with this mod then you MUST have this option enabled

If you wish to play this mod without the new Unleashed Score System by brianuuuSonic, just disable 
his mod and move the Unleashed HUD mod below the Addon in HedgeModManager



# FAQs
Q. Should I still use the other mods along with it?

A. No, this already has everything in it

Q. Whenever I have Chip Returns on it gives me an error where it says it should be above Sonic Unleashed HUD, even though it is. Is there a fix?

A:
- Go to chip returns mod folder
- Rename the .dll file to something else
- Open the mod.ini in said mod’s folder
- Where it says 'DLL File' replace the name with the new name you have given your .dll file and save
