## What is The True Unleashed EXP Overhaul?
This mod is a complete update - kinda - to the Unleashed EXP mod, and will have extra assets to it 
Such as:

• Adding Pure SU and Marza SU

• Adding a ‘Preview’ like SU model  

• Including the option to change between bracelet and non bracelet
 
• Changing up the physics

• Adding QTE Ramp-like physics (Trick Mastery must be enabled)

• Adding the proper unleashed boost (from Unleashing) to the models (might not add it to Marza Sonic though)

• Include the option to change between Unleashed and Beta Style Camera 

• Getting correct object textures and 1:1 sfx 

Making it the best experience of Sonic Unleashed in Sonic Generations
